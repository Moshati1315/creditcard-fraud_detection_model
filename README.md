# creditcard fraud detection machine learning model
I built a machine learning model that is about creditcard fraud detection. 
The project is broken into three phases. Each phase has a powerpoint presentation that clearly states the results and the objectives of the project. Please start with Phase 1 to begin understanding more about the work I did.
